# 🛒 Blinkit Grocery Sales Dashboard – Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Title  
**Blinkit Grocery Sales & KPI Dashboard Using Excel**

---

## 📈 Overview  

This project involved designing a powerful and interactive Excel dashboard to analyze Blinkit's retail sales performance across multiple dimensions such as item types, fat content, outlet type, outlet size, establishment year, and customer satisfaction metrics. The goal was to transform raw sales data into meaningful KPIs and business insights that would help optimize strategy, inventory, and marketing operations.

Using advanced Excel features—**Pivot Tables**, **Slicers**, **Charts**, **Data Validation**, **Conditional Formatting**, and **Dynamic Visualizations**—I built a fully functional, filterable dashboard that aligns with business KPIs and delivers actionable intelligence.
